# Hello-world
I produced many herbal medicines at my pharmacy (Tablet, Capsule, Syrup, Lotion, bed sore pads, Ointments and cosmetic cream and lotion and solution , ..) In Iran due to sanctions, It was not found medications ( Elase Oint.,..) and Camfeel pads to treat bed sores and diabetic wounds . I would produce herbal pads in my pharmacy, That the patients were very satisfy and treated quickly. In this pads, I used to D-acetilated mucilage, which is obtained from the reaction of breaking down alkaline, was used to stimulate cytokinas and hematopoietic growth factors (Hematopoiesis is a complex process that underlines the production of multiple highly specialized cells. They include interleukin-3 (IL-3), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and erythropoietin (EPO)). One of the essential properties of cedar is its antimicrobial properties. We can produce these pads and add Cedar Essential oil to the technology of making simultaneous repair and anti-infection pads.
